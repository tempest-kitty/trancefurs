v0.2.0
-Removed duplicate include of config.php from the header.php after it's included on index.php
-Changed a lot of PHP includes to require_once because that's what the pro's do!
-Content box cosmetic changes. Darker background and defined edges of the content.
-Moved STATS to a footer link and added a RULES to the nav bar, made an icon
-Added 'breadcrumbs' style text to the site title for page headings
-Navigation is now an array in the config and builds the navigation bar as opposed to a huge manually written file
-Navigation tabs now showing graphically

v0.2.1
-Added a bit of safety in a debug that checks current page in index.php (Cheers Kreegen, I'm sure I'd have got there xD)
-Added a strip_tags to the $currentPage variable which makes it safe to print on pages. Code can't be slipped.
-Set the fonts to just Sans-Serif because it looks better (Arial probably)
-Lowered the glow effect on hyperlinks
-Tabs on the nav bar now work

v0.3.0
-Added the 'content' system to allow all pages to be edited without pages of writing. Simulating a database using variables...
-Changed loads of grahics and styling again. I'm not listing all of it because I was tinkering for hours and can't remember what I did
