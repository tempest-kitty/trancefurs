<p>IRC is a command-based system. Users interact with an IRC network by sending messages and commands through their client to a server, where it is relayed to the rest of the network. IRC has been in use since the dawn of the internet, and is a great way to socialize with all of the other geeks out there.</p>

<p>A forward slash (/) indicates to your client that you are about to send a command. The following are common commands used with a forward slash:</p>

<p>msg - Send a private message to another user. The syntax is (/msg ). Most Graphical clients will open a new window on receiving this command.</p>

<p>ignore - Do not print messages received from target user. The syntax is (/ignore ). Not all clients support this command.</p>

<p>nick - Change your nickname, which identifies you to the rest of the IRC network. The syntax is (/nick )</p>

<p>All other nickname commands exist in the service NickServ. To use NickServ, send it a message with (/msg NickServ help). To register your nickname and become a regular user: (/msg NickServ REGISTER ). Email is used to establish ownership in case of theft; you will not receive any email from us unless this occurs.</p>

<p>Please also visit <a href="http://www.ircbeginner.com/ircinfo/ircc-commands.html">IRC for Beginners</a> for more information.</p>

<p>If you prefer the more interactive help and not being overwhelmed by it all at once you can use the server commands /msg ChanServ help or /msg NickServ help and follow the guidance there.</p>

//Help - How to Connect
$conHelpConnect = "
<p>Connecting to an IRC network is different for every client. You will have to consult your chosen client's method of operation to determine how exactly to proceed. Most clients will prompt you to enter in server information when you open the program. The following is the universal address for the TranceFurs IRC network:</p>

<p>irc.trancefurs.net</p>

<p>Port: 6667 (for SSL connections: 6664)</p>

<p>Additional options for connecting can be browsed on our SERVERS page.</p>

<p>Compare this to your options. Most clients will ask for a password; this is not necessary until you register to become a regular user. Nicknames are mandatory, real names are not. For more information please consult the ChanServ Service (/msg ChanServ help). For Nickname usage, registration, and management please consult NickServ (/msg NickServ) or contact a moderator.</p>

<p>Upon connecting you will be funneled into our main channel: #TranceFurs. Please stop by and say hello. You will most always find a moderator and helpful community members in this room.</p>

<p>Of course, we know you will want to come back, it's so relaxing and so inviting here...</p>

<h3>Mission Statement/Code Of Conduct</h3>

<p>This server has been established as a 'safe haven' for furs who have an interest in hypnosis and trancing. While we are not here to police what you do outside of this server, if we receive complaints of abuse, forced trance, unlawful behavior, etc. from one member about another even if that happens outside of TranceFurs, we will follow up and take appropriate action to maintain the safety of the community. This includes a formal warning up to and including being banned.</p>

<p>If the situation continues after removal from the server, we will help and advise affected parties with the appropriate course of legal action that may be available to them in their country of residence. There are many laws in relation to harassment in most countries, so please think twice about being stupid or harassing a fellow server user.</p>

<p>Thank you for taking to time to read the rules. You will find that following these simple rules will make your stay much more enjoyable and will make sure that you don't end up inadvertently banned from the server by doing something that could have been avoided.<p>

<p>The TranceFurs Staff holds sole responsibility for allowing access. The following are a list of offenses that could get you banned. Keep in mind that moderators can reprimand or remove access from anyone for ANY REASON and their decision may be upheld.</p>

<h2>1. Be nice and respectful</h2>
<p>This is a public-access server, and as such, people should be respectful of others. If you have an issue, there are always ops and mods around to help you out. Please don't take matters into your own paws.</p>

<h2>2. Age of Consent</h2>
<p>Please remember that is a mature server, and as such may contain material that is inappropriate for minors to view or read. The age of consent in a lot of countries is 18, but that can vary from place to place. Please be aware that we will actively police this policy, and if we find that it has been breached the relevant authorities will be notified and the persons involved will be k-lined.</p>

<p>We take personal safety very seriously. if you feel that someone is in breach of this rule, please let an admin know so that the matter can be promptly investigated.</p>

<h2>3. Trance and Consent</h2>
<p>Please remember even though TranceFurs is a hypnosis-based community, not everyone that visits the server is interested in being hypnotised. Please respect a user's right to not want to be hypnotised, as you may fall in breach of the code of conduct for this server. If someone is continually attempting to hypnotise you and you have clearly expressed that you are not interested, please reach out to an op or admin.</p>

<p>Furthermore, a user consenting to being hypnotised by another user does not automatically grant the hypnotist consent to do anything to or with that person. Remember this is a safe place, and we ask that you have good, open discussions with each other over what you do and don't feel comfortable with.</p>

<p>Remember the best rule of thumb here: â€œIf you donâ€™t know or are unsure... ASK ASK ASK! Clarify boundaries and establish rules. If you are going into territory that might be risky for you but you would still like to explore, fill in a third party so that they can monitor you for a bit. Safety is key.</p>

<p>This rule is taken very seriously. Depending on the circumstances and severity, not following this rule could result in anything from a formal warning to a first-time ban. This rule is in place between interactions between two regular members outside of the channel, as we hope to provide a safe community. All reports will be investigated to the best of our ability.</p>

<h2>4. Spam</h2>
<p>TranceFurs.net will not send you e-mails nor advertising in any form, and spaming adverts in main channels will also not be tolerated. If a user is found in breach of this rule, they may find themselves temporarily suspended from the server. Please don't spam users with advertising. Repeated instances of failure to adhere to this may result in being banned.</p>

<h2>5. Bots</h2>
<p>We do not mind the use of bots on the server; however, we ask that you speak to an admin before connecting a bot to the servers. We will just need a little detail on what it will be used for, as TranceFurs.net can also provide a bot for a lot of your needs.</p>

<h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
<p>In no event shall TranceFurs Network be Liable to any party for any damages including without limitation, any direct, indirect, special, punitive, incidental or consequential damages(including, but not limited to, damages for loss of business profits, business interruption, loss of programs or information, loss of profits and saving and the like), or any other damages Arising - in any way, shape or form - out of the availability, use, reliance on, inability to utilize or improper use TranceFurs Services even if TranceFurs Administration shall have been advised of the possibility of such damages, and regardless of the form of action, whether in contract, tort, or otherwise because some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, the above exclusions of incidental and consequential damages may not apply to you.</p>
