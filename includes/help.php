<p>IRC is a command-based system. Users interact with an IRC network by sending messages and commands through their client to a server, where it is relayed to the rest of the network. IRC has been in use since the dawn of the internet, and is a great way to socialize with all of the other geeks out there.</p><p>A forward slash (/) indicates to your client that you are about to send a command. The following are common commands used with a forward slash:</p><p>msg - Send a private message to another user. The syntax is (/msg ). Most Graphical clients will open a new window on receiving this command.</p><p>ignore - Do not print messages received from target user. The syntax is (/ignore ). Not all clients support this command.</p><p>nick - Change your nickname, which identifies you to the rest of the IRC network. The syntax is (/nick )</p><p>All other nickname commands exist in the service NickServ. To use NickServ, send it a message with (/msg NickServ help). To register your nickname and become a regular user: (/msg NickServ REGISTER ). Email is used to establish ownership in case of theft; you will not receive any email from us unless this occurs.</p><p>Please also visit <a href="http://www.ircbeginner.com/ircinfo/ircc-commands.html">IRC for Beginners</a> for more information.</p><p>If you prefer the more interactive help and not being overwhelmed by it all at once you can use the server commands /msg ChanServ help or /msg NickServ help and follow the guidance there.</p>

<p>Connecting to an IRC network is different for every client. You will have to consult your chosen client's method of operation to determine how exactly to proceed. Most clients will prompt you to enter in server information when you open the program. The following is the universal address for the TranceFurs IRC network:</p><p>irc.trancefurs.net</p><p>Port: 6667 (for SSL connections: 6664)</p><p>Additional options for connecting can be browsed on our SERVERS page.</p><p>Compare this to your options. Most clients will ask for a password; this is not necessary until you register to become a regular user. Nicknames are mandatory, real names are not. For more information please consult the ChanServ Service (/msg ChanServ help). For Nickname usage, registration, and management please consult NickServ (/msg NickServ) or contact a moderator.</p><p>Upon connecting you will be funneled into our main channel: #TranceFurs. Please stop by and say hello. You will most always find a moderator and helpful community members in this room.</p><p>Of course, we know you will want to come back, it's so relaxing and so inviting here...</p>
